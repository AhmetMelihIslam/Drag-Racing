# Drag Racing Demo

### This project includes an application where users can interact with a simple vehicle simulation

- Gas and Brake
  - The vehicle can move forward by pressing the gas button.
  - The vehicle can slow down or stop by pressing the brake.
  - No right or left. Only gas and brake. It goes straight.
  - The vehicle should operate with automatic transmission.

- Indicators
  - Speedometer (km/s)
  - Engine speed (rpm) and gear indicator

- Camera
  - A camera that can rotate around the vehicle should be controlled with the mouse.

- Wheel Movement
  - The wheels should turn in accordance with the movement of the vehicle.
  - The amount of wheel rotation should be calculated from the formula of the vehicle's travel distance / wheel circumference.

- Engine Sound
  - The pitch of the sound should change based on the engine speed.

- Start and Finish Line
  - There should be a 5-second countdown before the start, followed by a "Start" message.
  - The vehicle should be able to move when the "Start" message is displayed.
  - A length of approximately 500 meters for the track is sufficient.
  - The race should automatically end when crossing the finish line.
  - There should be a chronometer on the screen showing the elapsed time since the start.
